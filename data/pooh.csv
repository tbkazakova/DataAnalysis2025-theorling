0,IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE,"The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had: ""TRESPASSERS W"" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you _couldn't_ be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one--Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.  ""I've got two names,"" said Christopher Robin carelessly.  ""Well, there you are, that proves it,"" said Piglet.  One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.  ""Hallo!"" said Piglet, ""what are _you_ doing?""  ""Hunting,"" said Pooh.  ""Hunting what?""  ""Tracking something,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.  ""Tracking what?"" said Piglet, coming closer.  ""That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?""  ""What do you think you'll answer?""  ""I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh. ""Now, look there."" He pointed to the ground in front of him. ""What do you see there?""  ""Tracks,"" said Piglet. ""Paw-marks."" He gave a little squeak of excitement. ""Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?""  ""It may be,"" said Pooh. ""Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks.""  With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.  ""What's the matter?"" asked Piglet.  ""It's a very funny thing,"" said Bear, ""but there seem to be _two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?""  Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it really _was_ a Woozle.  ""You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they went together.  There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front of them....  Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him. ""_Look!_""  ""_What?_"" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way.  ""The tracks!"" said Pooh. ""_A third animal has joined the other two!_""  ""Pooh!"" cried Piglet. ""Do you think it is another Woozle?""  ""No,"" said Pooh, ""because it makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.""  So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before. _There were four animals in front of them!_  ""Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_""  And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.  ""I _think_,"" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, ""I _think_ that I have just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now.""  ""We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,"" said Pooh.  ""It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,"" said Piglet quickly. ""It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you say the time was?""  ""About twelve,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.  ""Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me----_What's that?_""  Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his.  ""It's Christopher Robin,"" he said.  ""Ah, then you'll be all right,"" said Piglet. ""You'll be quite safe with _him_. Good-bye,"" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger again.  Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.  ""Silly old Bear,"" he said, ""what _were_ you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time----""  ""Wait a moment,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.  He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up.  ""Yes,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh.  ""I see now,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh.  ""I have been Foolish and Deluded,"" said he, ""and I am a Bear of No Brain at All.""  ""You're the Best Bear in All the World,"" said Christopher Robin soothingly.  ""Am I?"" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.  ""Anyhow,"" he said, ""it is nearly Luncheon Time.""  So he went home for it."
1,IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL AND POOH FINDS ONE,"The Old Grey Donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, ""Why?"" and sometimes he thought, ""Wherefore?"" and sometimes he thought, ""Inasmuch as which?""--and sometimes he didn't quite know what he _was_ thinking about. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say ""How do you do?"" in a gloomy manner to him.  ""And how are you?"" said Winnie-the-Pooh.  Eeyore shook his head from side to side.  ""Not very how,"" he said. ""I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time.""  ""Dear, dear,"" said Pooh, ""I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you.""  So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.  ""Why, what's happened to your tail?"" he said in surprise.  ""What _has_ happened to it?"" said Eeyore.  ""It isn't there!""  ""Are you sure?""  ""Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn't there. You can't make a mistake about it. And yours _isn't_ there!""  ""Then what is?""  ""Nothing.""  ""Let's have a look,"" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that he couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came back to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, ""I believe you're right.""  ""Of course I'm right,"" said Pooh.  ""That Accounts for a Good Deal,"" said Eeyore gloomily. ""It Explains Everything. No Wonder.""  ""You must have left it somewhere,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh.  ""Somebody must have taken it,"" said Eeyore. ""How Like Them,"" he added, after a long silence.  Pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.  ""Eeyore,"" he said solemnly, ""I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you.""  ""Thank you, Pooh,"" answered Eeyore. ""You're a real friend,"" said he. ""Not like Some,"" he said.  So Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.  It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.  ""And if anyone knows anything about anything,"" said Bear to himself, ""it's Owl who knows something about something,"" he said, ""or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh,"" he said. ""Which it is,"" he added. ""So there you are.""  Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had both a knocker _and_ a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a notice which said:                     PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.  Underneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said:                    PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.  These notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only one in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDTOAST.  Winnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to left. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, ""Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking."" And the door opened, and Owl looked out.  ""Hallo, Pooh,"" he said. ""How's things?""  ""Terrible and Sad,"" said Pooh, ""because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?""  ""Well,"" said Owl, ""the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.""  ""What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?"" said Pooh. ""For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me.""  ""It means the Thing to Do.""  ""As long as it means that, I don't mind,"" said Pooh humbly.  ""The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then----""  ""Just a moment,"" said Pooh, holding up his paw. ""_What_ do we do to this--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me.""  ""I _didn't_ sneeze.""  ""Yes, you did, Owl.""  ""Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.""  ""Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.""  ""What I _said_ was, 'First _Issue_ a Reward'.""  ""You're doing it again,"" said Pooh sadly.  ""A Reward!"" said Owl very loudly. ""We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore's tail.""  ""I see, I see,"" said Pooh, nodding his head. ""Talking about large somethings,"" he went on dreamily, ""I generally have a small something about now--about this time in the morning,"" and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl's parlour; ""just a mouthful of condensed milk or whatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey----""  ""Well, then,"" said Owl, ""we write out this notice, and we put it up all over the forest.""  ""A lick of honey,"" murmured Bear to himself, ""or--or not, as the case may be."" And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying.  But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started, and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin.  ""It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me. Did you see them, Pooh?""  For some time now Pooh had been saying ""Yes"" and ""No"" in turn, with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, ""Yes, yes,"" last time, he said ""No, not at all,"" now, without really knowing what Owl was talking about.  ""Didn't you see them?"" said Owl, a little surprised. ""Come and look at them now.""  So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before.  ""Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?"" said Owl.  Pooh nodded.  ""It reminds me of something,"" he said, ""but I can't think what. Where did you get it?""  ""I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and----""  ""Owl,"" said Pooh solemnly, ""you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.""  ""Who?""  ""Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was--he was fond of it.""  ""Fond of it?""  ""Attached to it,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly.                   *        *        *        *        *  So with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards, he sang to himself proudly:      _Who found the Tail?_       ""I,"" said Pooh,     ""At a quarter to two       (Only it was quarter to eleven really),     _I_ found the Tail!"""
2,IN WHICH PIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP,"One day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: ""I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet.""  ""What was it doing?"" asked Piglet.  ""Just lumping along,"" said Christopher Robin. ""I don't think it saw _me_.""  ""I saw one once,"" said Piglet. ""At least, I think I did,"" he said. ""Only perhaps it wasn't.""  ""So did I,"" said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like.  ""You don't often see them,"" said Christopher Robin carelessly.  ""Not now,"" said Piglet.  ""Not at this time of year,"" said Pooh.  Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together. At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other; but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said, ""If you see what I mean, Pooh,"" and Pooh said, ""It's just what I think myself, Piglet,"" and Piglet said, ""But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember,"" and Pooh said, ""Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment."" And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice:  ""Piglet, I have decided something.""  ""What have you decided, Pooh?""  ""I have decided to catch a Heffalump.""  Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say ""How?"" or ""Pooh, you couldn't!"" or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that _he_ had thought about it first.  ""I shall do it,"" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, ""by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.""  ""Pooh,"" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, ""I will."" And then he said, ""How shall we do it?"" and Pooh said, ""That's just it. How?"" And then they sat down together to think it out.  Pooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and----  ""Why?"" said Piglet.  ""Why what?"" said Pooh.  ""Why would he fall in?""  Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late.  Piglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were raining already?  Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would _clear up_, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down.... When it would be too late.  Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap.  Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. _Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit?_  Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on.  ""But then he would see us digging it,"" said Pooh.  ""Not if he was looking at the sky.""  ""He would Suspect,"" said Pooh, ""if he happened to look down."" He thought for a long time and then added sadly, ""It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Heffalumps hardly _ever_ get caught.""  ""That must be it,"" said Piglet.  They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to himself, ""If only I could _think_ of something!"" For he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it.  ""Suppose,"" he said to Piglet, ""_you_ wanted to catch _me_, how would you do it?""  ""Well,"" said Piglet, ""I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and----""  ""And I would go in after it,"" said Pooh excitedly, ""only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then----""  ""Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of----I say, wake up, Pooh!""  Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, _he_ would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey, so he said, ""All right, honey then,"" just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, ""All right, haycorns.""  ""Honey,"" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now settled. ""_I'll_ dig the pit, while _you_ go and get the honey.""  ""Very well,"" said Pooh, and he stumped off.  As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair, and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and looked at it, and it _looked_ just like honey. ""But you never can tell,"" said Pooh. ""I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour."" So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. ""Yes,"" he said, ""it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,"" he said, ""somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a _little_ further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps _don't_ like cheese ... same as me.... Ah!"" And he gave a deep sigh. ""I _was_ right. It _is_ honey, right the way down.""  Having made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet looked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, ""Got it?"" and Pooh said, ""Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,"" and he threw it down to Piglet, and Piglet said, ""No, it isn't! Is that all you've got left?"" and Pooh said ""Yes."" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together.  ""Well, good night, Pooh,"" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's house. ""And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap.""  ""Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?""  ""No. Why do you want string?""  ""To lead them home with.""  ""Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.""  ""Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!""  ""Good night!""  And off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations for bed.  Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._ So he went to the larder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and found--nothing.  ""That's funny,"" he thought. ""I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that I should know it was honey. That's very funny."" And then he began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself. Like this:      It's very, very funny,     'Cos I _know_ I had some honey;     'Cos it had a label on,             Saying HUNNY.     A goloptious full-up pot too,     And I don't know where it's got to,     No, I don't know where it's gone--             Well, it's funny.  He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way, when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to catch the Heffalump.  ""Bother!"" said Pooh. ""It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps."" And he got back into bed.  But he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't. He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of Pooh's honey, _and eating it all_. For some minutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, ""Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better,"" Pooh could bear it no longer. He jumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the Six Pine Trees.  The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and Pooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it.  ""Bother!"" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. ""A Heffalump has been eating it!"" And then he thought a little and said, ""Oh, no, _I_ did. I forgot.""  Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick....  By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, ""Oh!"" Then he said bravely, ""Yes,"" and then, still more bravely, ""Quite so."" But he didn't feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was ""Heffalumps.""  What was a Heffalump like?  Was it Fierce?  _Did_ it come when you whistled? And _how_ did it come?  Was it Fond of Pigs at all?  If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference _what sort of Pig_?  Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference _if the Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM_?  He didn't know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!  Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs _and_ Bears? Wouldn't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go up to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should he do?  And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there _was_ a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn't, he wouldn't.  So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer he was _sure_ that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping about it like anything.  ""Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!"" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and looked in....  And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.  ""_Bother!_"" he said, inside the jar, and ""_Oh, help!_"" and, mostly, ""_Ow!_"" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down.  ""Help, help!"" cried Piglet, ""a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!"" and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, ""Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!"" And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin's house.  ""Whatever's the matter, Piglet?"" said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up.  ""Heff,"" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, ""a Heff--a Heff--a Heffalump.""  ""Where?""  ""Up there,"" said Piglet, waving his paw.  ""What did it look like?""  ""Like--like----It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well, like a--I don't know--like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.""  ""Well,"" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, ""I shall go and look at it. Come on.""  Piglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they went....  ""I can hear it, can't you?"" said Piglet anxiously, as they got near.  ""I can hear _something_,"" said Christopher Robin.  It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.  ""There!"" said Piglet. ""Isn't it _awful_?"" And he held on tight to Christopher Robin's hand.  Suddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh ... and he laughed ... and he laughed ... and he laughed. And while he was still laughing--_Crash_ went the Heffalump's head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh's head again....  Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together.  ""Oh, Bear!"" said Christopher Robin. ""How I do love you!""  ""So do I,"" said Pooh."
3,IN WHICH EEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY AND GETS TWO PRESENTS,"Eeyore, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and looked at himself in the water.  ""Pathetic,"" he said. ""That's what it is. Pathetic.""  He turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed across it, and walked slowly back on the other side. Then he looked at himself in the water again.  ""As I thought,"" he said. ""No better from _this_ side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.""  There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came Pooh.  ""Good morning, Eeyore,"" said Pooh.  ""Good morning, Pooh Bear,"" said Eeyore gloomily. ""If it _is_ a good morning,"" he said. ""Which I doubt,"" said he.  ""Why, what's the matter?""  ""Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't. That's all there is to it.""  ""Can't all _what_?"" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.  ""Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush.""  ""Oh!"" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and then asked, ""What mulberry bush is that?""  ""Bon-hommy,"" went on Eeyore gloomily. ""French word meaning bonhommy,"" he explained. ""I'm not complaining, but There It Is.""  Pooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded to him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a Bear of Very Little Brain. So he sang _Cottleston Pie_ instead:      Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,     A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly.     Ask me a riddle and I reply:     ""_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie._""  That was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't actually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second verse to him:      Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,     A fish can't whistle and neither can I.     Ask me a riddle and I reply:     ""_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.""  Eeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly to himself:      Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,     Why does a chicken, I don't know why.     Ask me a riddle and I reply:     ""_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.""  ""That's right,"" said Eeyore. ""Sing. Umty-tiddly, umty-too. Here we go gathering Nuts and May. Enjoy yourself.""  ""I am,"" said Pooh.  ""Some can,"" said Eeyore.  ""Why, what's the matter?""  ""_Is_ anything the matter?""  ""You seem so sad, Eeyore.""  ""Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year.""  ""Your birthday?"" said Pooh in great surprise.  ""Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had."" He waved a foot from side to side. ""Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink sugar.""  Pooh looked--first to the right and then to the left.  ""Presents?"" said Pooh. ""Birthday cake?"" said Pooh. ""_Where?_""  ""Can't you see them?""  ""No,"" said Pooh.  ""Neither can I,"" said Eeyore. ""Joke,"" he explained. ""Ha ha!""  Pooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.  ""But is it really your birthday?"" he asked.  ""It is.""  ""Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.""  ""And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.""  ""But it isn't _my_ birthday.""  ""No, it's mine.""  ""But you said 'Many happy returns'----""  ""Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do you?""  ""Oh, I see,"" said Pooh.  ""It's bad enough,"" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, ""being miserable myself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper notice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be miserable too----""  This was too much for Pooh. ""Stay there!"" he called to Eeyore, as he turned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he must get poor Eeyore a present of _some_ sort at once, and he could always think of a proper one afterwards.  Outside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach the knocker.  ""Hallo, Piglet,"" he said.  ""Hallo, Pooh,"" said Piglet.  ""What are _you_ trying to do?""  ""I was trying to reach the knocker,"" said Piglet. ""I just came round----""  ""Let me do it for you,"" said Pooh kindly. So he reached up and knocked at the door. ""I have just seen Eeyore,"" he began, ""and poor Eeyore is in a Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice of it, and he's very Gloomy--you know what Eeyore is--and there he was, and----What a long time whoever lives here is answering this door."" And he knocked again.  ""But Pooh,"" said Piglet, ""it's your own house!""  ""Oh!"" said Pooh. ""So it is,"" he said. ""Well, let's go in.""  So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it down.  ""I'm giving this to Eeyore,"" he explained, ""as a present. What are _you_ going to give?""  ""Couldn't I give it too?"" said Piglet. ""From both of us?""  ""No,"" said Pooh. ""That would _not_ be a good plan.""  ""All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party. I'll go and get it now, shall I?""  ""That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.""  So off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his jar of honey.  It was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than half-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the soles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying, ""Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.""  ""Dear, dear,"" said Pooh, ""I didn't know it was as late as that."" So he sat down and took the top off his jar of honey. ""Lucky I brought this with me,"" he thought. ""Many a bear going out on a warm day like this would never have thought of bringing a little something with him."" And he began to eat.  ""Now let me see,"" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of the jar, ""where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore."" He got up slowly.  And then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday present!  ""_Bother!_"" said Pooh. ""What _shall_ I do? I _must_ give him _something_.""  For a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought: ""Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I washed it clean, and got somebody to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it, Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful."" So, as he was just passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who lived there.  ""Good morning, Owl,"" he said.  ""Good morning, Pooh,"" said Owl.  ""Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday,"" said Pooh.  ""Oh, is that what it is?""  ""What are you giving him, Owl?""  ""What are _you_ giving him, Pooh?""  ""I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask you----""  ""Is this it?"" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.  ""Yes, and I wanted to ask you----""  ""Somebody has been keeping honey in it,"" said Owl.  ""You can keep _anything_ in it,"" said Pooh earnestly. ""It's Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask you----""  ""You ought to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it.""  ""_That_ was what I wanted to ask you,"" said Pooh. ""Because my spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places. Would _you_ write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?""  ""It's a nice pot,"" said Owl, looking at it all round. ""Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?""  ""No,"" said Pooh. ""That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it.""  Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl licked the end of his pencil, and wondered how to spell ""birthday.""  ""Can you read, Pooh?"" he asked a little anxiously. ""There's a notice about knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Robin wrote. Could you read it?""  ""Christopher Robin told me what it said, and _then_ I could.""  ""Well, I'll tell you what _this_ says, and then you'll be able to.""  So Owl wrote ... and this is what he wrote:                   HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.  Pooh looked on admiringly.  ""I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',"" said Owl carelessly.  ""It's a nice long one,"" said Pooh, very much impressed by it.  ""Well, _actually_, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh.' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that.""  ""Oh, I see,"" said Pooh.  While all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to get Eeyore's balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that it shouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to Eeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the first one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without being told by anybody. And running along, and thinking how pleased Eeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.  BANG!!!???***!!!  Piglet lay there, wondering what had happened. At first he thought that the whole world had blown up; and then he thought that perhaps only the Forest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps only _he_ had, and he was now alone in the moon or somewhere, and would never see Christopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, ""Well, even if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face downwards all the time,"" so he got cautiously up and looked about him.  He was still in the Forest!  ""Well, that's funny,"" he thought. ""I wonder what that bang was. I couldn't have made such a noise just falling down. And where's my balloon? And what's that small piece of damp rag doing?""  It was the balloon!  ""Oh, dear!"" said Piglet ""Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear! Well, it's too late now. I can't go back, and I haven't another balloon, and perhaps Eeyore doesn't _like_ balloons so _very_ much.""  So he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he came to the side of the stream where Eeyore was, and called out to him.  ""Good morning, Eeyore,"" shouted Piglet.  ""Good morning, Little Piglet,"" said Eeyore. ""If it _is_ a good morning,"" he said. ""Which I doubt,"" said he. ""Not that it matters,"" he said.  ""Many happy returns of the day,"" said Piglet, having now got closer.  Eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream, and turned to stare at Piglet.  ""Just say that again,"" he said.  ""Many hap----""  ""Wait a moment.""  Balancing on three legs, he began to bring his fourth leg very cautiously up to his ear. ""I did this yesterday,"" he explained, as he fell down for the third time. ""It's quite easy. It's so as I can hear better.... There, that's done it! Now then, what were you saying?"" He pushed his ear forward with his hoof.  ""Many happy returns of the day,"" said Piglet again.  ""Meaning me?""  ""Of course, Eeyore.""  ""My birthday?""  ""Yes.""  ""Me having a real birthday?""  ""Yes, Eeyore, and I've brought you a present.""  Eeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear, turned round, and with great difficulty put up his left hoof.  ""I must have that in the other ear,"" he said. ""Now then.""  ""A present,"" said Piglet very loudly.  ""Meaning me again?""  ""Yes.""  ""My birthday still?""  ""Of course, Eeyore.""  ""Me going on having a real birthday?""  ""Yes, Eeyore, and I brought you a balloon.""  ""_Balloon?_"" said Eeyore. ""You did say balloon? One of those big coloured things you blow up? Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?""  ""Yes, but I'm afraid--I'm very sorry, Eeyore--but when I was running along to bring it you, I fell down.""  ""Dear, dear, how unlucky! You ran too fast, I expect. You didn't hurt yourself, Little Piglet?""  ""No, but I--I--oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!""  There was a very long silence.  ""My balloon?"" said Eeyore at last.  Piglet nodded.  ""My birthday balloon?""  ""Yes, Eeyore,"" said Piglet sniffing a little. ""Here it is. With--with many happy returns of the day."" And he gave Eeyore the small piece of damp rag.  ""Is this it?"" said Eeyore, a little surprised.  Piglet nodded.  ""My present?""  Piglet nodded again.  ""The balloon?""  ""Yes.""  ""Thank you, Piglet,"" said Eeyore. ""You don't mind my asking,"" he went on, ""but what colour was this balloon when it--when it _was_ a balloon?""  ""Red.""  ""I just wondered.... Red,"" he murmured to himself. ""My favourite colour.... How big was it?""  ""About as big as me.""  ""I just wondered.... About as big as Piglet,"" he said to himself sadly. ""My favourite size. Well, well.""  Piglet felt very miserable, and didn't know what to say. He was still opening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't any good saying _that_, when he heard a shout from the other side of the river, and there was Pooh.  ""Many happy returns of the day,"" called out Pooh, forgetting that he had said it already.  ""Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them,"" said Eeyore gloomily.  ""I've brought you a little present,"" said Pooh excitedly.  ""I've had it,"" said Eeyore.  Pooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was sitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself.  ""It's a Useful Pot,"" said Pooh. ""Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that writing is. And it's for putting things in. There!""  When Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.  ""Why!"" he said. ""I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!""  ""Oh, no, Eeyore,"" said Pooh. ""Balloons are much too big to go into Pots. What you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon----""  ""Not mine,"" said Eeyore proudly. ""Look, Piglet!"" And as Piglet looked sorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and placed it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground; and then picked it up again and put it carefully back.  ""So it does!"" said Pooh. ""It goes in!""  ""So it does!"" said Piglet. ""And it comes out!""  ""Doesn't it?"" said Eeyore. ""It goes in and out like anything.""  ""I'm very glad,"" said Pooh happily, ""that I thought of giving you a Useful Pot to put things in.""  ""I'm very glad,"" said Piglet happily, ""that I thought of giving you Something to put in a Useful Pot.""  But Eeyore wasn't listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting it back again, as happy as could be....                   *        *        *        *        *  ""And didn't _I_ give him anything?"" asked Christopher Robin sadly.  ""Of course you did,"" I said. ""You gave him--don't you remember--a little--a little----""  ""I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.""  ""That was it.""  ""Why didn't I give it to him in the morning?""  ""You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with icing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar, and----""  ""Yes, _I_ remember,"" said Christopher Robin."
